    "## The Larger Ecosystem of Big Data Technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytics PaaS Products**\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python on its own is an important tool of data science, the nature of \"big data\" requires a multi-technology approach in most cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Early discussions of the technology of \"big data\" typically revolved around Hadoop and MapReduce given they were some of the first tools that could handle Internet-scale data sources. These technologies had the ability to scale horizontally (increasing capacity by adding more computing devices or nodes) compared to traditional approaches that required vertical scaling (increasing capacity by adding processing power to a single computer or cluster). Horizontal scaling meant firms like Google and Yahoo! could use low-cost, commodity hardware to build out systems that could handle massive amounts of data via parallel processing. Not only were such systems more cost effective than the traditional super-computing approaches, but they could support much, much higher scale. We will discuss Map Reduce in more detail during week 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "More recently, a whole variety of different technologies have emerged both in response to not only the larger scale, but also the increased focus on \"analytics 3.0\" applications. This week we will explore the general category of cloud-based analytics technologies that usually fall into the Platform as a Service (PaaS) category. These cloud offerings enable firms to outsource the management of various \"big data\" functions to technology firms both large and small. [Amazon (Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/), [Google (Cloud Platform)](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/bigdata/), and [Microsoft (Azure)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/topics/big-data/) all have extensive PaaS \"big data\" offerings. More specialist providers like [HortonWorks](http://hortonworks.com/) and [Databricks](https://databricks.com/) are even hoping to make the entire process of data science accessible to their customers, not just the analysis tools. Databricks, for example, describes their product as:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Data science made easy, from ingest to production.\n",
    ">We believe big data should be simple. \n",
    ">Apache Spark™ made a big step towards this goal. Databricks makes Spark easy through a cloud-based integrated workspace. (https://databricks.com/product/databricks - Nov 2015)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python in the PaaS Ecosystem**\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python is a strong technology contender in desktop and server-based data science, it is also being used in these PaaS products as both an underlying technical foundation and as a common data science API. Two examples of this include Amazon's Redshift which now has [user defined functions (UDFs) that are written in Python](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/user-defined-functions-for-amazon-redshift/) and [Apache Spark which has a robust Python API](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks like this one are also part of the products of \"big data\" offerings of Databricks, Google, and Amazon:\n",
    "\n",
    "* https://databricks.com/product/databricks#notebooks\n",
    "* https://cloud.google.com/datalab/\n",
    "* https://blogs.aws.amazon.com/bigdata/post/TxX4BY5T1PQ7BQ/Using-IPython-Notebook-to-Analyze-Data-with-Amazon-EMR\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we are going to add Google's BigQuery analytics platform to our workflow as an exemplar of the broader category of \"big data\" PaaS offerings. We will begin with a short description of BigQuery and then move on to working with some of the public datasets on BigQuery.\n"

    "## Google BigQuery\n",
    "\n",
    "Google BigQuery is the \"productization\" of the technology that was code named \"Dremel\" at Google. In their 2010 whitepaper, Google described Dremel as:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Dremel is a scalable, interactive ad-hoc query system for analysis\n",
    "of read-only nested data. By combining multi-level execution\n",
    "trees and columnar data layout, it is capable of running aggregation\n",
    "queries over trillion-row tables in seconds. The system scales\n",
    "to thousands of CPUs and petabytes of data, and has thousands\n",
    "of users at Google. (http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/36632.pdf - Nov 2015)\n",
    "\n",
    "The whitepaper gave the following examples of how Google has been using Dremel since 2006:\n",
    "\n",
    ">* Analysis of crawled web documents.\n",
    ">* Tracking install data for applications on Android Market.\n",
    ">* Crash reporting for Google products.\n",
    ">* OCR results from Google Books.\n",
    ">* Spam analysis.\n",
    ">* Debugging of map tiles on Google Maps.\n",
    ">* Tablet migrations in managed Bigtable instances.\n",
    ">* Results of tests run on Google’s distributed build system.\n",
    ">* Disk I/O statistics for hundreds of thousands of disks.\n",
    ">* Resource monitoring for jobs run in Google’s data centers.\n",
    ">* Symbols and dependencies in Google’s codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the high level, by focusing on a read-only and columnar data structure instead of a traditional relational database, Google was able to achieve high scale and good interactive performance. Compared to MapReduce models which are batch based, the technology behind Dremel could enable an interactive data science workflow.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Following the Amazon model of turning internal technologies into PaaS offerings, Google launched BigQuery as a product in 2010. They describe the product as:\n",
    "\n",
    ">BigQuery is Google's fully managed, NoOps, low cost data analytics service. With BigQuery you have no infrastructure to manage and don't need a database administrator, use familiar SQL and can take advantage of pay-as-you-go model. This collection of features allows you to focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights. BigQuery is a powerful Big Data analytics platform used by all types of organizations, from startups to Fortune 500 companies."

    "\n",
    "A common model for sending data to BigQuery splits tables into different time intervals. Querying across such intervals is easy as multiple tables with the same schema can be added to the <code>FROM</code> statement separated by a comma. For example, Google Analytics Premium customers can get raw, hit level data exported to BigQuery. The table naming convention for this appends the specific date of the extract to the table name like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>dataset.ga_sessions_20151115</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to having a list of comma separated tables, BigQuery allows queries that define a time-based wildcard to retrieve specific date ranges without a scan of all tables like:\n",

    "SELECT COUNT(*)\n",
    "FROM (TABLE_DATE_RANGE(dataset.ga_sessions_, \n",

For desktop analysis, this submodule works by using [OAuth2.0](http://oauth.net/2/) to authenticate the desktop application as a valid user of the BigQuery account. Practically, you accomplish this by being logged into BigQuery in your default browser and then running the the <code>gbq</code> method.\n",
