    "**Assignment**: This exercise will use a live, publicly accessable API to collect multiple categories of data in order to conduct analyses and create visulizations.  Spefically, you will:\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Collect data from a public website\n",
    "* Read data into dataframes\n",
    "* Develop a research question(s)\n",
    "* Inform that research question with visualizations\n",
    "* Inform that research question with basic statistics\n",
    "* Provide a short write up of your analysis\n",
    "* Generalize this analysis to \"big data\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you will have to complete all the tasks within this notebook, save the entire notebook, and then upload into the Week 2 Assignment for your group on BlackBoard. Save this notebook with a new name with the following format:\n",

    "\n",
    "These in-class exercises are designed to allow you to explore Python with your group and **DO NOT** include step-by-step directions or answers that have only one possibility. Use your team and other resources to determine how best to complete them. Make sure before you turn in your notebook that it runs without errors and the requested output is visible in the notebook. If you go through multiple steps in your code, make sure all those steps are included so that we can evaluate your work."

    "## Basketball Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we are going to use the National Basketball Association's statitics site. We will be using a Python library called [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) to send a URL to their http://stats.nba.com site to query it for player shot data. Requests makes it easy to do \"web scaping\" like this. The data returned from the website is JSON, but we will reading that JSON into a pandas dataframe for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make the retreival of the data easier, we have written a function that will return the shot statistics for any player for the 2014-2015 season. You have already been using simple functions like <code>type</code> and <code>id</code>, but in this case we are writing our own. Once you run the code in the cell below, the function <code>get_shot_stats</code> will be available for you to use just as any other Python function. Our function has one input parameter which is the NBA's player id.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code in the following block to make the function available for use in the notebook namespace."

    "The data collected and plotted yielded something rather unexpected by us, that Harden is a consistent 3-pt shooter, throughout the entire game (average of all games).  Harden is able to perform at 37.4% accuracy in the first half of games with his 3-pt attempts, and still able to perform the same during the second half of games (at 37.3%).  This, combined with the plot against the court, show us several interesting conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first half of the game, when we presume Harden is well rested and ready to start the game fresh, is no different than when he plays the second half, when we expect him to be degraded in his athletic ability due to fatigue.\n",
    "2. Number of shots attempted vs made remains at the same proportion in the second half of the games, indicating that he is not under more pressure to score more points in order to win a game (we anticipated this proportion to perhaps go down, meaning more attempts and missed buckets if he were trying to rally from behind to help his team win).\n",
    "3. The number of shots between the first and second halves of the games only varied by a difference of 20; this indicates to us that once again, he consistently shoots on average 277 3-pt attempts, per half (of all games, not per game).\n",
    "4. Based on the visual in the graph, Harden prefers to take his shots from the “point” (top of the arc) of the 3-pt line, and is also most successful here.  Additionally, the “wings” (between the point and the corners) is his next best area where he attempts and is successful.  He is least likely to shoot from and be successful at the corners of the 3-pt line (where the 3-pt line meets the baseline)."

    "* How might data available from public websites be part of a \"big data\" strategy?\n",
    "Part of the concept of \"big data\" is that data is everywhere, from hundreds/thousands/millions of resources, and covering a broad range of information topics.  Furthermore, deeper within the concept of \"big data\" is that individual users (such as our group in this class) do not need to collect/gather, and then store all this data.  Instead, using a public website as part of the \"big data\" strategy, the information that may be useful to someone is easily and readily available, without the need for the data to be duplicated and re-housed in various locations by each user looking to extract information from the data.  This approach expands the idea of the Internet, whereby one resource (a webpage) is available to billions of people from a single source of data (the web server that the webpage resides upon).\n",
    "\n",
    "* What might be some of the challenges of this approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the challenges using public websites can included (but are not limited to) the following:\n",
    "- Changes in the public source that cause references to break/links to no longer work\n",
    "- Communication of changes in the data; on a public site, there is no \"onus\" upon which the data source must be sure to notify users of the data repository of any changes, or worse yet, complete removal of the data source.\n",
    "- Guarantee of data integrity by the public source, especially if supplied by a public community site (such as Wikipedia) where most anyone could edit and potentially corrupt the data source\n",
